	<h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>WEB TECHNOLOGIES</u></h1>
	<img src="http://hdtechno.com/images/sample/slider/HD_Technologies_Banner3.jpg" width="100%">
	<p>In order to make websites look and function a certain way, web developers utilize different languages. The three core languages that make up the World Wide Web are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
	<p>In the IT world, the internet is an essential platform, whether its for developing or for consumer use. When developing a website, typically three main languages come into play. These languages are JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. HTML is the backbone of most webpages. Essentially, it is used to create the structure of how a specific website would look like, from the headings, to the paragraphs, the body, links, and even images.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="markup">Markup Languages</a></h2>
	<p>Markup languages are the languages in which the web is written. The most common markup language used is HTML, which uses tags to annotate text so that a computer can then manipulate the text. Most markup languages are human readable, and use annotations that are distinguishable from the annotated text. There are many different kinds of markups and languages, but all are consistent in the way in which they annotate documents.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="hyper">Hypertext</a></h2>
	<p>Hypertext is defined as the arrangement of information inside a database that allows the user to receive information and to navigate from one document to another by clicking on highlighted words or pictures inside the primary document. Hypertext is the base of the World Wide Web, because it enables user to click on other links to get more information. Hypertext is a term used for all links, whether it appears as texts or other graphical part.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="html">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a></h2>
	<p><img class="images" src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Versions-of-Html.png">HTML is the conventional markup language used to create and edit web pages and web applications. HTML is used for creating the basic structure of a website. HTML consists of different elements preceded by an opening tag, &lt;tag&gt;, and a closing tag, &lt;/tag&gt;. The content between the tags, &lt;html&gt; and &lt;/html&gt;, is the content of the webpage. The content between the tags, &lt;head&gt; and &lt;/head&gt;, is the title of the webpage. This text is displayed between the &lt;title&gt; and &lt;/title&gt; tags. The content between the tags, &lt;body&gt; and &lt;/body&gt;, is the main content of the webpage. The content can include links , paragraphs, headings, and various other elements.</p>
	<h3>HTML Major Versions</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>HTML 2.0</li>
		<li>HTML 3.2</li>
		<li>HTML 4.0</li>
		<li>XHTML</li>
		<li>HTML 5.0</li>
	</ul>

	<h2><a name="http">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</a></h2>
	<p>HTTP is the protocol used by the World Wide Web that determines how messages are formatted and transmitted. It also directs web servers and browsers to what actions they should take in reaction to several commands. When you open your web browser and enter a URL, you are using HTTP. The Web server directs it to get and transmit the requested Web page based on the HTTP command that is sent.</p>
	<h3>HTTP Protocol</h3>
	<p>HTTP is an application used as the fundamental foundation of communication on the web. HTTP is the first letter you type in when inputting a web address. HTTP is a request - response protocol. The client might request something and the http allows the client to access the information. Like when we updated our virtual machines the request we wanted was to go get updates for the software and http request went out and got updates. If you were on a bank website or the wikibook site it would be https the ‘s’ meaning secure. That means that the computer is communicating on a secure network.</p>

	<h2><a name="css">Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)</a></h2>
	<p><img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/csspages/images/types-of-css.png" class="images">
	CSS is a style sheet language standard set by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) used to create and edit the visual presentation of web pages. CSS allows web developers to isolate a web page's content and visual styles into separate documents and gives better page layout control. An external CSS sheet is generally linked to HTML and XHTML, it also can be linked to XML, SVG, and XUL. HTML and Javascript, with CSS, is a vital part of technology used by the majority of interfaces for websites. This is also used in interfaces for mobile devices making the websites more engaging.</p>
	<h3>Types of CSS</h3>
	<p>CSS can be incorporated with HTML in 3 different ways: 
		<ol>
			<li>Inline</li>
			<li>Internal</li>
			<li>External</li>
		</ol>
	</p>

	<h3>Client-Side Scripting</h3>
	<p><img src="https://techdifferences.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/image2.jpg" class="images">
	Generally refers to computer programs on the web that are executed by the user's web browser, instead of on a web server, enabling web pages to be scripted. Client-side scripts do not require additional software on the server but instead utilize the user's web browser to understand the scripting language in which it is written.</p>
	<h3>Server-Side Scripting</h3>
	<p>Server-side scripting is a technique used in web development that involves using scripts on a web server which produce a unique response for each user's request to the website.</p>
	<h3>Combination technologies</h3>
	<p>When both client side and server side scripting collectively build a webpage it is known as a web application. This web application can manage user interaction, security, and help improve performance between the client and server. Web applications can include anything from online stores to instant messaging services as long as both server and client sides execute scripts to a achieve a common goal in unison.</p>

	<h2><a name="js">JavaScript</a></h2>
	<p>
		<img src="https://stackify.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Javascript-vs-Typescript.jpg" class="images">
	JavaScript is a scripting language that is used along with HTML and CSS as the three core components of the World Wide Web. JavaScript has first-class functions and is used in most websites. JavaScript does not have any I/O which means that it has to be embedded in the host environment. JavaScript is also used in PDF documents, game development, and desktop and mobile applications. JavaScript is most commonly used to make DHTML by adding client-side behavior to HTML pages.</p>
